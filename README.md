# MEB Wildlife Photography: Discover Nature

LOGO

## I would like to share my journey and passion of nature and its interactions. This will be a welcoming website for people to enjoy, get tips and share their insights with others on amateur photography. On this website you will get to experience some of the locations I have visited and photographed as well as some of the amazing organisms you can find accessible and out in nature. This website is aimed at users who have a passion for nature photography both landscape and organism and for those who like me, are armature photographers. Navigation through the website will be accomplished through a navigation bar which will remain constant at the top of the page. The website will be split into 4 main sections. “Home” will be eye catching and give a summary of what the user can expect to find in the website. “Photos” will display all the different galleries of photos I have taken. “About” will provide information about me and how I got into natural photography as well as the equipment I use. “Contact” will give the user the opportunity to contact me, offer advice and support or even share some of the images they have managed to capture. I hope you will enjoy the content I have created and my passion for all things nature.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

* Simplistic black text on white background with vibrant colours from the photographs.

### Typography

*	The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.

### Imagery

*	Imagery is critical. A large hero image banner is designed to be eye catching whilst being consistent in all main pages on the website. The image will change on each main page, but the size and location will remain constant. These images should be striking and catch the users attention.
